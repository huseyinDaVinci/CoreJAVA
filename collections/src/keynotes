Java Collection classes enable the storing of primitives or object references in one place in memory.



------------------------------------
                                            ARRAY LIST
List<String> names=new ArrayList<String>();
ArrayLists  actually use internally pre-defined fixed-sized array.
   Getting element from the ArrayList names.get(5) is a constant time ( big O(1))  because the index is known just get the element from this index.
   Insertion/Deletion like names.put("makaveli") is a linear time (big O(n)) because a new fixed size array will be created internally and the elements of
   old array will be copied to newer. This traversing will cause linear time.

   numsArray=new int[]{5,6};  numsArrayList=new ArrayList<Integer>(){5,6};    which one is faster?  numsArray[2]   numsArrayList[2]
   of course int[] array will be faster(but cannot be considered difference) but both of them big O(1) just arraylist Just in Time will do some extra check op.
